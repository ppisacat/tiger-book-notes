
* Alignment
  memory alignemnt: 32 bits / 64 bits
  sometimes we have to add padding to satisfied OS's alignment policy

* Stack Machine
** Only storage is a STACK
** Compare to register-machine
   - (register machine): add r1, r2, r3 -> (stack machine): add
   - making programs more compact for it doesn't have to store the locations of operands/result -- they're ALWAYS on top of the stack
